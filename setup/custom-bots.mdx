    </Step>
    <Step title="Copy values">
        To create your custom bot, you require the values: `Client ID`, `Client
        Secret`, <br /> `Bot Token`, and `Public Key`. These can be found in the
        `General Information` and `Bot` tabs. But, if you need help finding
        them, refer to guide below.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add A Redirect URL">
        Head to `OAuth2 ➔ Redirects` and add a redirect URL as
        `https://resurrect.to/api/callback`. This is so we can ensure the user
        verifies on your server.

        <Note>
            If you are using a custom domain, replace `resurrect.to` with
            your domain.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add A Interactions Endpoint URL">
        <Warning>
