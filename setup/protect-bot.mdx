## Why should I protect it?

Your bot is linked to your authorized members, meaning that if Discord was to terminate your bot, you will lose access to all your members.

## How can I protect it?

<Warning>
    This will not always protect it, but it will minimise the risk of it being
    terminated.

<Card title="Never use your main account" icon="square-1" color="#CE4425">
    <p>
        <strong>NEVER</strong> use your main account. Always use a clean, new
        account which has no connections to your main account. This prevents
        Discord easily terminating your bot.
    </p>

<Card title="Do not sell your Verified Members" icon="square-2" color="#CE4425">
    <p>
        <strong>NEVER</strong> sell your verified members. This is against
        Discord&apos;s <strong>Terms of Service</strong>
        and may result in your bot being terminated.

<Card title="Use Customization Options" icon="square-3" color="#25CE7A">
    <p>
        Use our provided customization, such as Custom Domains. This hides the
        resurrect brand, and makes it harder for Discord to terminate your bot.

<Card title="Add the bot to a team" icon="square-4" color="#25CE7A">
    <Warning>
        Do NOT add your main account to the team, as this will defeat the point.
    </Warning>
    <p>
        Using Discord's provided
        <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/teams">Teams</a>
        feature, you can add your bot to a team, and add other accounts.

<Card title="Purchase a premium plan" icon="square-5" color="#25CE7A">
    <p>
        By purchasing a premium plan, you get more features that can hide the
        identity of your bot. Meaning, it can make it difficult for Discord to
        terminate your bot.
