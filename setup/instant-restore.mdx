## What is an Instant Restore?

An instant restore is a process that occurs when your server gets deleted, and it will automatically restore your server to the latest backup.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a Backup">
        First, you need to create a backup. <br />
        You can do this by running the command `/backup` within the server you want
        to backup.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Enable Instant Restores">
        Now, navigate to `Dashboard ➔ Manage Servers ➔ Your Server` and find the
        option <strong>Allow Instant Restores</strong>, and enable it.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Now your done!">
        Once your server gets deleted, it will restore the server to the latest
        backup. <br /> Including the server details, channels, messages, roles,
        etc.
