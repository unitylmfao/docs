    <Accordion icon="people" title="Who runs resurrect.site?">
        resurrect.site is ran by a small group of people. We were sick of the
        lack of features and security on other sites, so we decided to change
        the game.

    <Accordion icon="money-bill" title="Do you charge money to use resurrect?">
        No, we do not charge money to use resurrect. We do, however, have a
        premium subscription that gives you access to more features at a
        reasonable price.

        title="I've just verified on a server, do they have my IP?"
    >
        Nope, that's why we are different. Server owners can't see your IP, but
        they do see your `Hashed IP`. This is only used for server owners to
        identify scammers, and returning users who may not be welcome on their
        server.

        You can always visit our `Pricing` via our website to see what features
        we have to offer. We are always adding new features, so be sure to check
        back often!

    <Accordion icon="box" title="I want to use this for myself, can I?">
        Of course! You can always use our `Dashboard` to create your own server
        and gain verified members.
