## How to setup?

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to your server">
        Ensure you have set everything else up, but navigate to `Dashboard ➔
        Manage Servers ➔ Your Server`.
    </Step>
    <Steps title="Get the Channel ID">
        This can seem difficult but it's quite easy. Go to your server and right
        click on the channel you want to use for the logs. Then click `Copy
        Channel ID` or refer to the image below.

    <Step title="Now back on the dashboard!">
        Go back to the dashboard and paste the channel ID into the box and save
        your settings.
    </Step>

## I don't see the Copy Channel ID button!

No need to panic, its quite easy to enable it. Go to `Settings ➔ App Settings ➔ Advanced ➔ Developer Mode` on Discord and enable it. After you have done that, you can complete the steps.
