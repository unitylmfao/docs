### "Hmm. Seems like you tried something that isn't allowed."

This is related to our security within verification. If you get this error, simply try again through the same embed. If you continue to get this error, please contact us.

### "It appears that the bot is Missing Permissions"

This can be related to a lot of things. Make sure you have done the below.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Give the bot some permissions!">
        Make sure the actual bot role has `Administrator` regardless. Without
        it, the bot will not function properly.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Role Positioning">
        Make sure the bot role is above the roles you want to give to users. If
        the bot role is below the roles you want to give to users, it will not
        work.
    </Step>
    <Step title="2FA Requirement for Moderators">
        If the Discord Server has the "2FA Requirement for Moderators Actions"
        enabled, it can prevent the bot from giving roles. You can either:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Disable the "2FA Requirement for Moderators Actions" in the
                Discord Server Settings
            </li>
            <li>Enable 2FA on the Discord Account that owns the Discord Bot</li>
        </ul>
    </Step>
</Steps>

### "There was an error with the bot. Please contact the bot owner."

This is a really rare issue, but it can happen. If you get this error, please contact us.
